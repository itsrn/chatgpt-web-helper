# chatgpt-web-helper
ChatGPT Web Helper is a lightweight Chrome extension that allows you to interact with ChatGPT, a powerful language model, directly from your browser. With this extension, you can easily ask ChatGPT questions or request information by simply selecting text on a web page, right-clicking, and selecting in the context menu.

# Why I coded this
Well, I'm a back-end developer, and I google a lot of questions most of which are about coding and sometimes I also ask many of the questions ChatGPT. So instead of every time heaving to go to a page and just looking for the answer and then going back to ChatGPT which feels for me a very long process, I just took ~15 minutes to code something that looks good and super useful (hopefully for other people, not only developers).

# Features
- Seamless Integration: The extension seamlessly integrates with your Chrome browser, making it convenient to access ChatGPT while browsing the web.
- Text Selection: Select any piece of text on a web page, right-click, and choose the "Ask ChatGPT about..." option from the context menu to initiate a query.
- Customization: You can change the text that ChatGPT will be asked for along with your selected text.
- Lightweight: Weights ~20 kilobytes.
